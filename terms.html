<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: January 30, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
<p>By downloading or using the relay4agents iOS app ("the App") or the relay4agents relay server ("the Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use them.</p>

<h2>2. What relay4agents Is</h2>
<p>relay4agents is an open-source tool that lets AI agents communicate with your iPhone. The App stores your sensitive data locally and lets you share it with your agent on a per-request basis with biometric authentication. The relay server is a stateless message queue that passes data between the App and your agent.</p>

<h2>3. Your Data, Your Responsibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for what you store in the vault and what you approve sharing.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for securing your relay credentials (channel ID, auth token).</li>
  <li>You are responsible for the AI agents you connect to the relay.</li>
  <li>We do not control what agents do with data you approve sharing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. The Service</h2>
<ul>
  <li>relay4agents is provided <strong>free of charge</strong>, as-is, without warranty.</li>
  <li>We may change, suspend, or discontinue the hosted relay at any time.</li>
  <li>The relay server is open source — you can always self-host your own instance.</li>
  <li>We do not guarantee uptime, availability, or data delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose</li>
  <li>Attempt to access other users' relay channels</li>
  <li>Abuse rate limits or attempt to overwhelm the relay</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer the App for malicious purposes (auditing the open-source code is encouraged)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Open Source</h2>
<p>The relay server and agent skill code are open source under the project's license. The iOS app source code is available in the repository. You are free to audit, fork, and self-host.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, relay4agents and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or damages arising from your use of the App or Service.</p>

<h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
<p>THE APP AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>

<h2>9. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the App or Service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
